  <h2 class="header">Scuba diving</h2>
  <p class="article">
        Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater.[1] Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.[1] Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving">Click for the source</a>

  <p class="article">
        Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) is an international federation that represents underwater activities in underwater sport and underwater sciences, and oversees an international system of recreational snorkel and scuba diver training and recognition. It is also known by its English name, the World Underwater Federation, and its Spanish name, Confederación Mundial De Actividades Subacuáticas. Its foundation in Monaco during January 1959 makes it one of the world's oldest underwater diving organisations.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confédération_Mondiale_des_Activités_Subaquatiques">Click for the source</a>

  <h2 class="header">PADI</h2>
  <p class="article">
        The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) is a [3] recreational diving membership and diver training organization founded in 1966 by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson.[3] Cronin was originally a NAUI instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break diver training down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Association_of_Diving_Instructors">Click for the source</a>
