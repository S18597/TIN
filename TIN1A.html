    <i>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</i><br>
    It is a period of <mark> civil war</mark>. <strong > Rebel <br>
    spaceships, striking from a hidden <br>
    base, have won their first victory</strong> <br>
    against <em>the evil Galactic Empire.</em>

  <p>
    <del>During the battle, Rebel spies managed <br>
    to steal secret plans to the Empire's <br>
    ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an <br>
    armored space station with enough <br>
    power to destroy an entire planet. </del>

    that can save her people and <ins><br>
    freedom to the galaxy.... </ins>
